"""What ``predict`` does when the table is bigger than the context window.

Nori reads at most a window of labeled rows per call. Above that, *something* has to
choose which rows the model sees. Today that choice is made by memory pressure:
``NoriPredictor`` finds the context does not fit its element budget, drops rows at
random to make it fit, and warns (``ContextSubsampledWarning``). The result is the
`random` policy — one arbitrary window — arrived at by accident rather than on purpose.

This module makes it a decision. Above ``large_context_threshold`` rows, a **policy** from
:mod:`synthefy_nori.inference.policies` decides the context and chains the calls, and
the per-call subsample never engages because every context handed to the predictor is
already within the window.

    NoriRegressor(large_context_policy="cluster_route").fit(X, y).predict(X_test)

``cluster_route`` is the default because it is the only arm measured across all 15
benchmark tables without a regression. ``safeboost``, ``boost``, ``random``,
``target_rank``, ``cluster_route_g4``, a ``holdout_gate`` over any of them, and custom callables
are all selectable. **The menu, each arm's measured cost and its tail risk live in**
``policies.py`` — one home per number, so they cannot drift apart. ``boost``'s tail is
severe; read it there before selecting it.

**This is off by default** (``large_context_policy=None`` keeps today's behavior exactly).
The evidence is a within-checkpoint policy comparison on 15 tables, not a guarantee
about your table, and turning it on multiplies the number of forward passes per predict.
Opt in, and read :attr:`NoriRegressor.large_context_report_` to see what actually ran.
